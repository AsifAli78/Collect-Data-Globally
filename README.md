# Collect-Data-Globally
Computational Tools for Digital Data Collection

## Description
The focus concerning this laboratory act digital data collection utilizing R (most cases), Python, and UNIX command-line forms. Three lecture-style meetings will present graduate students to state-of-the-art methods in web-scraping, pdf-scraping, and social publishing scraping. Three conference-style courses will supply graduate pupils accompanying the space to accept response on methods for collecting data.The objective of this mill is practical: graduate graduates will develop and execute data groups procedures in each of the three having a theme modules, accompanying the definitive result being three complete and clean datasets. As such, we will want graduate juniors complicated in the studio to label money---like, managerial databases, recorded as actually having happened documents, friendly publishing reports---that they wish to scrape.
